Thank you for purchasing Shuteye.  Your privacy and security is very 
important to me and your purchase tells me it's important to you, too.

To start your video session you, as the host, open the following

For when you don't want to just communicate with yourself I have 
provided you with another URL. Just copy and paste the below text 
block below in an email. Your invitees will follow the link to join
you.
